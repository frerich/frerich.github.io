# Resume of Frerich Raabe

## Personal Information

* Born in 1982 in Cuxhaven, Germany
* Currently living in Hamburg, Germany
* Married, one child

## Education

* 2001 - German Abitur at the Technisches Gymnasium Wilhelmshaven (technical high scool)
* 2005 - Left University of Oldenburg after studying Computer Science for
  five semsters (stopped studying because I was hired by froglogic GmbH)

## Skills

* German: First language
* Engish: Fluent
* 13 years of C++ on Unix (FreeBSD & Linux), 7 years on Windows (Visual Studio 6
  up to Visual Studio 2012), 5 years on macOS
* Knowledgeable about x86 assembly, Python, Haskell, C, Rust, Python,
  JavaScript, Elixir
* Multiple years of experience with CVS, Subversion and Git for source
  control management
* Long-time vim user
* Cruise Control, Hudson and Jenkins for continuous integration
* Used raw Makefiles (hand-written as well as generated by automake),
  [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and [qmake](http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.7-snapshot/qmake-manual.html)
  for building various software projects.
* Can work alone with very little supervision as well as contribute as
  part of a team.

## Professional Experience

## August 2021 -- present: [BetterDoc GmbH](https://www.betterdoc.com)

* Worked on microservice architecture built using Elixir, using technologies
  like Phoenix, Phoenix LiveView or Ecto.
* Helped maintain a Kubernetes cluster for running services
* Provisioned EC2 and RDS instances on AWS
* Helped maintain AWS CloudWatch configuration and Route53 configurations
* Used Terraform to maintain AWS resources
* Used Ansible to maintain EC2 instance hosting a remote desktop system
  (Ubuntu) used by other team members.

## May 2021 -- August 2021: [Welect GmbH](https://www.welect.de)

* Part of a small (3 person) software engineering team building a web platform
  (including a web UI) using JavaScript, SCSS and Elixir (Ecto + Phoenix).
* Hosted the application in Docker containers running on five Amazon Elastic
  Beanstalk instances
* The code processed approx. 30 million HTTP requests per month.
* Conducted job interviews, responsible for hiring additional colleagues.

## October 2005 - April 2021: [froglogic GmbH](http://www.froglogic.com)

* Second employee of the company (now over 35 employees)
* Full-time software development position, mostly on Windows but partly on
  FreeBSD, Solaris and Linux
* Rewrote large parts of an existing program parsing C++ headers and
  generating introspection code so that the generated code compiles to a size
  which is 25% of the original size by reducing the amount of symbols being
  defined and replacing code with lookup tables.
* Ported a C program which provided functionality similiar to LD_PRELOAD on
  Linux on Windows so that it works for 64bit applications. The application
  can be used to loading arbitrary DLLs into a program before any code in
  the program is executed (including constructors of global objects or the
  like). This required generating 64bit assembly code for Intel from C.
* Designed and implemented a framework in pure C++ & STL which is used to model
  many differnet GUI toolkits (Windows toolkits such as WPF as well as Adobe
  Flex or Android) uniformly. This toolkit is still being used to implement
  object recognition of various GUI controls in the main product of froglogic,
  [froglogic Squish](http://www.froglogic.com/squish/gui-testing/).
* Embedded a Ruby interpreter in a C++ program so that Ruby scripts can be used
  for composing GUI tests.
* Developed a debugger for Tcl scripts (the default Tcl C library has no such
  notion as a 'trace' function which allows tracing the script execution) which
  works by parsing and instrumenting the Tcl source code. It allows recognizing
  breakpoints, single-stepping etc..
* Added 'variable watcher' capability for embedded Python, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl
  and Ruby interpreters. This feature allows inspecting the variables in scope
  for any of those scripting languages at any point in time.
* Created an integration plugin for [HP Quality
  Center](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1172141)
* Designed an XML-based format for encoding test results of automatic GUI
  tests. This format is still being used for exchanging data between various
  processes used internally by Squish - it is also used when customers export
  their test results into files.

Other, non software-development related activities include:

* I was part of the team which conducted job interviews for software engineering
  positions for about four years.
* I ported and maintained the entire documentation of the main company product
  from SGML to DocBook; introduced a toolchain which allows building HTML as
  well as PDF documentation from the DocBook sources.
* Staffed the froglogic booth at various conferences in Europe and the USA.
* I created and maintained an IMAP server running exim and dovecot on FreeBSD; the
  system authenticates users against an LDAP database. This system is used every
  day by almost the entire company and required no maintenance efforts in the last
  twelve months.
* Conducted on-site trainings for customers on two occasions.
* Coordinates release testing and packaging for a number of product releases.
* I was part of the team which founded the US office (in Burlingame,
  California) and stayed in the Bay Area for three months.

# Open Source Contributions

I was a very active [KDE](http://www.kde.org) contributor between 2000 and
2005 (at which point I got hired by froglogic); the email address
raabe@kde.org can still be used to contact me. I gained write access to the
kde-core-devel (the mailinglist used for communication between KDE core
developers who were entitled to work on the build system or the core
libraries) in about 2002. There's an
[interview with me](http://www.behindkde.org/frerich-raabe) available
on-line (I was 19 at that time, pardon the sillyness).

I was--and still am--also a contributor to various other open source
projects; I did publish a few projects myself, too.

## KDE Contributions

* Wrote KNewsTicker, a very popular panel application for reading newsfeeds
  in RSS format in a ticker-style view; written in C++ using Qt (Qt 3.x at the
  time).
* Co-Maintained KHelpCenter, the main entry point into the help system
  of KDE. The application transformed DocBook files to HTML on the fly (using
  XSLT) and presented those in an embedded HTML component (KHTML); C++ with
  Qt.
* Wrote the main KDE build script used by KDE developers, 'kde-build'; this
  shell script (pure 'sh', no 'bash') updated a local checkout of othe KDE
  sources (via CVS, which used to be the source control system of KDE at the
  time), configured and compiled it. About 35kB of shell script used on a lot
  of different Unix flavors (which makes writing the shell script not quite
  trivial).
* Made the default email client used by the desktop environment configurable.
* Various other bugfixes all over the code base.

## Other Open Source Contributions

* Contributed the support for handling .netrc files to the Hex package manage
  used by virtually all Elixir projects (cf. [Hex pull request #925](https://github.com/hexpm/hex/pull/925)).
* Wrote the XPath 1.0 engine for KSVG, the SVG rendering component in KDE.
  This code was eventually integrated into WebKit by Apple because of which
  my name is now mentioned in the Acknowledgements of every WebKit-based
  browser (such as Chrome or Safari). The code is visible in the XPath\*
  files in the WebCore source tree, e.g. in
  [XPathPredicate.h](http://source-android.frandroid.com/external/webkit/Source/WebCore/xml/XPathPredicate.h)
* Wrote [elfrc](https://github.com/yashi/elfrc) (unfortunately my original
  homepage is not accessible anymore, so I'm linking to a fork of my project
  on github). It is a resource compiler for ELF systems (such as Linux). This
  program, written in pure C90, converted arbitrary files into ELF object
  files which could then get linked into libraries and applications. It did
  so without invoking a compiler, so very large files could be linked into
  applications (which is not the case when converting a file into a char
  array). This was originally meant to be used for self-extracting
  installers on Linux, but is now being used for all kinds of purposes, such
  as for building software for embedded devices by some Japanese vendor.
* Wrote [clcache](https://github.com/frerich/clcache), a Python program which
  works as a compiler cache for Microsoft Visual Studio. It behaves much like
  [ccache](http://ccache.samba.org/) does for gcc.
* Early contributor to [distcc](http://code.google.com/p/distcc/); I contributed
  portability fixes for FreeBSD (as mentioned in the
  [NEWS](http://code.google.com/p/distcc/source/browse/trunk/NEWS#604) file
  of the source code) as well as documentation improvements.
* Listed as a [FreeBSD
  contributor](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/contrib-additional.html)
  for creating FreeBSD ports (the software packaging system
  used on FreeBSD) for various programs such as
  [VCool](http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/sysutils/fvcool.html),
  [rc5pipe](http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/security/rc5pipe.html),
  [selfhtml](http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/german/selfhtml.html) and others. I
  also contributed to the default package management program on FreeBSD,
  `pkg_add`. [This query](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?category=&severity=&priority=&class=&state=&sort=none&text=&responsible=&multitext=&originator=frerich+raabe&closedtoo=on&release=)
  lists all my contributions to FreeBSD in detail.
* Completely rewrote the [freebsd.kde.org](http://freebsd.kde.org/) website
  using PHP and maintained it for a few months.
* Ported the [mach_override](https://github.com/rentzsch/mach_override) project,
  which allows hooking C functions on OS X, to use the
  [udis86](http://udis86.sourceforge.net/) disassembler.

# Further Activity

* I'm an active contributor to the [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
  website, my [profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/91757/frerich-raabe)
  details the questions I answered as well as the badges I earned.

* I'm a [mentor on the Exercism project](https://exercism.org/profiles/frerich)
  for the Haskell language track, reviewing code of students and providing
  feedback.
